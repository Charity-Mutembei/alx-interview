### 1. Base Case:

If n is less than or equal to 1, we return 0 because there is already one 'H' character in the file.

    if n <= 1:
    return 0

### 2. Initialize DP Array:
Create an array dp to store the minimum number of operations for each position from 1 to n.

    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)

We use float('inf') to represent an uninitialized state, and we'll update it during the dynamic programming process.

### 3. Base Case Initialization
Set dp[1] = 0 because it takes 0 operations to have one 'H' character.

    dp[1] = 0

### 4. Dynamic Programming Loop:
Iterate from 2 to n to fill in the DP array.

    for i in range(2, n + 1):

### 5. Factorization Loop:
For each i, iterate through all possible factors j from 2 to the square root of i.

    for j in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):

### 6. Update DP Array:
If i is divisible by j, update dp[i] by considering two possibilities:

Copy and paste j times.
Use the result for j and paste (i //) times.

    if i % j == 0:
    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + i // j, dp[i // j] + j)


### 7. Handle Prime Numbers:
If dp[i] is still float('inf') after the factorization loop, it means i is a prime number. In this case, the only way is to copy and paste i times

    if dp[i] == float('inf'):
    dp[i] = i

### 8. Return Result:

Finally, return the minimum number of operations needed to achieve n H characters.

    return dp[n]

This dynamic programming approach optimally considers all possible factorizations of each i and updates the minimum operations needed to reach i H characters. The result is stored in the dp array, and the final answer is dp[n]
